            <strong>Sticking with the Status Quo</strong> The list of commonly rejected proposals includes the subject of this proposal: <div class="chatlog__markdown-quote">
              <div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div>
              <div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">if/else and switch as expressions: These are conceptually interesting things to support, but many of the problems solved by making these into expressions are already solved in Swift in other ways. Making them expressions introduces significant tradeoffs, and on balance, we haven't found a design that is clearly better than what we have so far. </div>
            </div> The motivation section above outlines why the alternatives that exist today fall short. One of the reasons this proposal is narrow in scope is to bring the majority of value while avoiding resolving some of these more difficult trade-offs. The lack of this feature puts Swift's claim to be a modern programming language under some strain. It is one of the few modern languages (Go being the other notable exception) not to support something along these lines.</span></div>
