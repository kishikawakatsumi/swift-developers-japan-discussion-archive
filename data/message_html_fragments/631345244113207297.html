Here's why: 1. Combine is too new and may have lots of destructive changes in the future, just like when Swift came out; where RxSwift is based on a well developed theory ReactiveX, which has been used on products for many years and has a very wide user base. 2. Combine can only be used on iOS later than 13, where RxSwift doesn't have that kind of limitation 3. Actually combine doesn't declare itself as a "Reactive Framework", therefore you don't see concepts like Stream, or Hot/Cold observables etc. Instead, Combine is just a <span class="pre pre--inline">framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time</span> (according to Combine's document). It has many things similar with Reactive programming, but it's not a Reactive tool. But personally, I would prefer Combine much better over RxSwift.</span>
