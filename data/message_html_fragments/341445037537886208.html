          <span class="preserve-whitespace">Chris Lattner が興味深いこと↓を言ってる。 <div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">I tend to prefer that exploration in this space happen in order of points above, and would prefer not to get to a generalized macro system for a couple of years - just to give Swift more time to mature and develop without it. Other languages have gotten macro systems too early in their development, and become too reliant on it. Perhaps if C didn’t have one it would have ended up with a proper import mechanism. Perhaps if Rust didn’t have one, some of its decisions would have been different. etc.</div></span>
